		<h1>Nitrogen</h1>
		<p>Nitrogen was first found and classified as an element in 1772. The physician to discover this great element was Daniel Rutherford. The name of this element was derived from the Greek language from the word 'nitron', which means nitre forming. In the periodic table, nitrogen is the 7th element right after carbon and before oxygen. This element is part of the 15th group and is in the 2nd period. This element of nitrogen is a diatomic non-metal organized by the periodic table to categorize this. Nitrogen has a boiling point of −195.795&deg;C, −320.431&deg;F. This also has a melting point of −210.0°C, −346.0°F. (<a href="http://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/7/nitrogen">RSC, 2017</a>)</p>
		<h2>Uses of Nitrogen</h2>
		<p>Nitrogen is important to the chemical industry. It is used to make fertilizers, nitric acid, nylon, dyes and explosives. To actually manufacture these products, you need to create a chemical reaction between the nitrogen and hydrogen. This reaction creates a polyatomic ion called ammonium (NH3+).(<a href="http://www.livescience.com/28726-nitrogen.html">Agata Blaszczak-Boxe, 2017</a>) It can then be used as a physical product. Nitrogen gas is also used this way to preserve foods, and in the electronics industry. Large portions of nitrogen are used in making stainless steel and other steel products. Liquid nitrogen is often used as a refrigerant. It is used for storing human cells of the reproductive system. It is also used to freeze foods, maintaining moisture, colour, flavour and texture.</p>
		<h2>Biological Role of Nitrogen</h2> 
		<p>Nitrogen is cycled naturally by living organisms through the ‘nitrogen cycle’. It is taken up by green plants and algae as nitrates, and used to build up the bases needed to construct DNA, RNA and all amino acids. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. Animals obtain their nitrogen by consuming other living things. They digest the proteins into their amino acids, creating them for their own use. Microbes in the soil convert the nitrogen compounds back to nitrates for the plants to re-use. The nitrate supply is also refilled by nitrogen-fixing bacteria that ‘fix’ nitrogen directly from the atmosphere. (<a href="http://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/7/nitrogen">RSC, 2017</a>)</p>

		<h2>Facts about Nitrogen</h2> 
		<p>Nitrogen is one of the most commonly used elements in the world. There is much variety to this element and some interesting facts can come along with it. (<a href="http://www.chemicool.com/elements/nitrogen.html"> Chemicool, 2017)</a> Here are a few fun facts about the element of nitrogen:
		
		<ol type="I"> 
			<li>Nitrogen is believed to be the seventh most abundant element in the universe</li>
			<li>The human body contains about 3% nitrogen</li>
			<li>Nitrogen gas can be a health hazard in that it can displace available oxygen, causing harm without prior warning due to the body's ability to take in nitrogen</li>
			<li>Nitrogen is required to build amino acids</li>
			<li>All living things contain nitrogen, mostly in amino acids, DNA, RNA</li>
