		<h2 class="second">What is my Superpower?</h2>
		<p class="first">My superpower is <b>Water polo</b>. Water polo is a very physical and competitive sports and really shows the capabilities of swimming and throwing. From being able to wrestle big opponents to scoring the ball into the wide, 5 meter net. The game consists of four quarters in which the two teams attempt to score goals by throwing the ball into their opponent's goal. The team with the most goals at the end of the game wins the match. A team consists of 6 field players and one goalkeeper in the water at any one time. With the constant wrestling, swimming, throwing, and thinking it creates an intricate way of playing and creates a fast paced game to witness.</p> 
		<h2 class="second">How did I get this power?</h2>
		<p class="first">About 6 years ago in the year 2011, I was at a local swimming pool having a good dandy time. Later on in that day, a gentleman walked towards me and asked if I would like to participate in this sport for a &dblac; tryout&dblac; . I accepted this offer and my journey began from there. I first came to Victoria Park C.I for my first practice and have continued to play ever since. Every year my talent grew and my knowledge rose, creating the water polo talent.</p> 
		<h2 class="second">What do you do with this power?</h2> 
		<p class="first">With this water polo talent, I go all around Canada to participate in monthly tournaments and camps. The areas usually stay close to eastern Canada usually switching from Quebec or Ontario. The talent is a great way to get out and see new cities, new people and create new friendships. This team game is focused on giving a strict environment for everyone to train and on improving one's self daily.</p>
